
Image matching web application
•	Designed and implemented a web application with streamlit that can manage image matching from the collections of user-input image files or folders. 
•	Utilize and adjust the SuperGlue pre-trained model, which extracts matching features from each picture pair using a Graph Neural Network. 
•	The final output includes the points that match between the two images, and a file that contains key points that are extracted during the process are ready to be used for tasks like Structure from Motion (SFM) and so on.
